#Memer App#
#Problem Statement:#
Does a meme a day keep the doctor away? Not quite, but it looks like it might help. According to one recent study memes helped people cope with life during the COVID-19 pandemic .Researchers found that those who viewed memes — a type of humour they described as funny or cute pictures that reference pop culture — reported "higher levels of humour" and more positive feelings . COVID-19 times has been a real challenge to people’s psychological health and a little bit of humour and tint of laughter is all they need to cherish their safe being.

#Proposed Solution:#
This project proposes a Visual Meme display App called “Memer” to display some of the best memes sourced from the birthplace of many memes and one of the dankest place on the Internet i.e. “Reddit”. Its features include visual display of meme in jpg format , “next” button to randomly swap to next meme. It accepts input  as next from the “next” button placed distinctly in the Graphical user interface. This application uses Reddit’s open to developers API to source memes from the platform straight to your device . Currently the app works with Reddit only. The project's scope is to extend it for other platforms like Instagram , Memeshare etc. with the option to browse topic wise memes and sharing ability to social media .

 






 
#Functionality & Concepts used :#
    • The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the user browse top memes from Reddit using their “hot” post sorting algorithm implemented in the API location. 
    • Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :
    • Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
    • Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of familiar interface with interactive next button and minimal design made it easier for users to navigate users without any clutters.
    • We used volley library to make the networking easy .
    • We used API to call random meme.

#Application Link & Future Scope :#
Currently this app is used by my friends and family. After proper implementations of other functionalities, we will launch this app globally. You can access the app from here-‘https://github.com/myselfrohit51/ASJ_APP’
